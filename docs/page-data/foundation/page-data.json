The GraphQL Foundation encourages contributions, stewardship, and a shared investment from a broad group in vendor-neutral events, documentation, tools, and support for GraphQL.\n\nGraphQL was created in 2012 and open sourced by Facebook in 2015. In 2019, Facebook and others [created the GraphQL Foundation](https://foundation.graphql.org/news/2019/03/12/the-graphql-foundation-announces-collaboration-with-the-joint-development-foundation-to-drive-open-source-and-open-standards/) as a neutral, non-profit home for the GraphQL assets and ongoing collaboration, and hosted by [The Linux Foundation](https://linuxfoundation.org). The GraphQL Foundation is a fully neutral home for the GraphQL trademark, and provides a means of collecting and distributing membership dues to support core community infrastructure and programs.\n\n## The GraphQL Foundation supports the community\n\nThe primary mission of the GraphQL Foundation is to ensure that the GraphQL community is able to focus on the continued evolution of the [specification](https://spec.graphql.org) and [reference implementations](/code/). We accomplish this through a number of core activities:\n\n* Funding grants for project maintainers and community gardeners.\n* Coordinating and funding mentorship programs.\n* Providing collaboration infrastructure.\n* Managing the GraphQL trademark and related policies.\n* Providing legal support for projects.\n* Operational and logistical support through The Linux Foundation.\n\nThe GraphQL Foundation works in close collaboration with the [GraphQL Working Group](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/) and the [GraphQL TSC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md).\n\n## Members support the GraphQL Foundation\n\nThe GraphQL Foundation would like to thank [our current members](/foundation/members/) for their ongoing support to ensure the sustainability of the GraphQL ecosystem. Learn more about how your company can demonstrate its commitment to GraphQL by [becoming a member of the GraphQL Foundation](https://graphql.org/foundation/join).\n\n\nIf you have questions, you can reach out to [membership@graphql.org](mailto:membership@graphql.org).\n\n\n"},"nextDoc":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Become a Member","permalink":"/foundation/join/"}}},"pageContext":{"permalink":"/foundation/","nextPermalink":"/foundation/join/","sideBarData":[{"name":"GraphQL Foundation","links":[{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ks.choi/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/About.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is the GraphQL Foundation?","permalink":"/foundation/","next":"/foundation/join/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":null,"sidebarTitle":"About the Foundation","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"b54e3132-8c7a-51ea-89b7-7e0d7f07f60d"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ks.choi/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/Join.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Become a Member","permalink":"/foundation/join/","next":"/foundation/community-grant/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":"GraphQL Specification,GraphQL Foundation","sidebarTitle":"Join GraphQL","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"12de18a5-29c0-5011-bffb-fe22a0bc1f1e"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ks.choi/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/CommunityGrantProgram.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"GraphQL Community Grant","permalink":"/foundation/community-grant/","next":"/foundation/contact/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":"How to apply,FAQs","sidebarTitle":"Community Grant","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"155744fc-6a16-5768-847e-a4b444bfb4d3"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ks.choi/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/Contact.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Contact the GraphQL Foundation","permalink":"/foundation/contact/","next":"/foundation/annual-reports/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":"Membership Inquiries,Membership Support,Meeting Logistics,Trademark Requests,Media Inquries,Technical Issues,General","sidebarTitle":"Contact us","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"4d659fea-873b-5dee-931a-139ea244a117"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ks.choi/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/AnnualReports.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Annual Reports","permalink":"/foundation/annual-reports/","next":"/foundation/members/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":null,"sidebarTitle":"Annual Reports","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"1a946c30-75dd-562f-b6ff-1cd3467a9c0f"},{"frontmatter":{"sidebarTitle":"Foundation Members","title":"Foundation Members","permalink":"/foundation/members/","date":null,"category":"GraphQL Foundation"}},{"frontmatter":{"sidebarTitle":"GraphQL Landscape","title":"GraphQL Landscape","permalink":"https://landscape.graphql.org/","date":null,"category":"GraphQL Foundation"}}]}],"sourcePath":"src/content/foundation/About.md"}},
