The goal of the program is to provide financial support and incentives for key technical and community initiatives.\n\nThe GraphQL Community Grant program accepts applications on a quarterly cycle. Grant applications are reviewed by the TSC based upon funding that is received as membership dues for the GraphQL Foundation. This is one way in which the GraphQL Foundation directly supports the ongoing health of the GraphQL developer ecosystem.\n\nWe would like to encourage you to be creative in your grant application, and propose tasks that are straightforward to articulate, achievable in three months, and bounded in scope.\n\nExamples include:\n\n* Finishing an outstanding feature that has been untended\n* Community gardening, such as clarifying documentation of community processes, getting started guides for newcomers, maintaining \"Good first issue\" lists, or organizing a community collaboration.\n* Community advocacy, such as writing a deep-dive blog documenting a specific feature, writing a whitepaper, or creating an outreach program.\n\n## How to apply\n\nThe GraphQL Community Grant Program [accepts applications at any time](https://grant-application.graphql.org), and evaluates all undecided applications four times per year. All applications will be closed after an evaluation cycle has completed. Applicants may re-apply at any point.\n\nTo apply, please complete the [GraphQL Community Grant Program application](https://grant-application.graphql.org).\n\n## FAQs\n\n### Do I need to be developing the specification or code to apply?\n\nWhile we anticipate most applications will be for new technical development, we also encourage applications for community-building activities. Examples include community gardening and neutral advocacy for GraphQL adoption.\n\n### What work is expected?\n\nApplications should describe work that can be completed in two to three months. Additionally, we'll ask you to write a blog post report after three months describing your work and its impact on the GraphQL community.\n\n### What amount of money is available per grant?\n\nThe grant amount offered will depend on our available funding and the number of approved grants per cycle. Individual grants are expected to be between $1,000 and $10,000 USD.\n\n### How often can I apply?\n\nYou can apply one time per cycle. You can apply in every cycle regardless of whether you had a past application selected or closed in a prior cycle.\n\n### Who is eligible?\n\nAny individual working in the GraphQL developer community who can receive a payment from a US-based\norganization. Please note that this program is not work-for-hire, and this is not an employment arrangement.\n\n*Only individuals are eligible to receive funding.*\n\n### Are there any restrictions on what I produce?\n\nYes. All outcomes from the grant must be for the benefit of the GraphQL community, meaning that code\nmust be contributed to public repositories under an appropriate open source license (generally MIT).\nPublications and documentation should be available to the public and not behind a paywall. We also\nexpect every recipient to write a blog post summarizing the work they've done and how it benefits\nthe community at large.\n\nIn summary, the GraphQL Community Grant Program is for the benefit of the GraphQL community. We want\neverything that is produced under this program to be usable by our community.\n\n### Do I have to sign anything?\n\nYes, if your proposal is selected you will need to sign the GraphQL Grantee Agreement ([preview](https://grantee-agreement-preview.graphql.org) in order to receive the funding. It is your responsibility to read and understand the contents of the agreement.\n\n## More information\n\nIf you have questions, please contact [operations@graphql.org](mailto:operations@graphql.org).\n"},"nextDoc":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Contact the GraphQL Foundation","permalink":"/foundation/contact/"}}},"pageContext":{"permalink":"/foundation/community-grant/","nextPermalink":"/foundation/contact/","sideBarData":[{"name":"GraphQL Foundation","links":[{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ks.choi/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/About.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"What is the GraphQL Foundation?","permalink":"/foundation/","next":"/foundation/join/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":null,"sidebarTitle":"About the Foundation","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"b54e3132-8c7a-51ea-89b7-7e0d7f07f60d"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ks.choi/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/Join.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Become a Member","permalink":"/foundation/join/","next":"/foundation/community-grant/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":"GraphQL Specification,GraphQL Foundation","sidebarTitle":"Join GraphQL","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"12de18a5-29c0-5011-bffb-fe22a0bc1f1e"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ks.choi/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/CommunityGrantProgram.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"GraphQL Community Grant","permalink":"/foundation/community-grant/","next":"/foundation/contact/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":"How to apply,FAQs","sidebarTitle":"Community Grant","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"155744fc-6a16-5768-847e-a4b444bfb4d3"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ks.choi/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/Contact.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Contact the GraphQL Foundation","permalink":"/foundation/contact/","next":"/foundation/annual-reports/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":"Membership Inquiries,Membership Support,Meeting Logistics,Trademark Requests,Media Inquries,Technical Issues,General","sidebarTitle":"Contact us","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"4d659fea-873b-5dee-931a-139ea244a117"},{"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/ks.choi/graphql.github.io/src/content/foundation/AnnualReports.md","parent":{"relativeDirectory":"foundation","sourceInstanceName":"content"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Annual Reports","permalink":"/foundation/annual-reports/","next":"/foundation/members/","category":"GraphQL Foundation","sublinks":null,"sidebarTitle":"Annual Reports","date":null,"tags":null},"id":"1a946c30-75dd-562f-b6ff-1cd3467a9c0f"},{"frontmatter":{"sidebarTitle":"Foundation Members","title":"Foundation Members","permalink":"/foundation/members/","date":null,"category":"GraphQL Foundation"}},{"frontmatter":{"sidebarTitle":"GraphQL Landscape","title":"GraphQL Landscape","permalink":"https://landscape.graphql.org/","date":null,"category":"GraphQL Foundation"}}]}],"sourcePath":"src/content/foundation/CommunityGrantProgram.md"}},
