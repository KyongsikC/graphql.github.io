Participants acknowledge and agree to The Linux Foundation's exclusive right to use \"GraphQL\" and any other names and trademarks associated with the GraphQL open source project and GraphQL Specification and to authorize others’ use of the marks, establish guidelines for such use, and to delegate these responsibilities. Participants agree not to take any action inconsistent with such rights and to cooperate in any action which The Linux Foundation deems necessary or desirable to prevent confusion or establish or preserve these rights. Participants will not independently adopt, use, or attempt to register any trademarks or trade names that are confusingly similar to these names.\n\n## Scope\n\nThis Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.\n\n## Enforcement\n\nInstances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the Executive Director, or, if the complaint involves the Executive Director, a member of the steering committee. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of  specific enforcement policies may be posted separately. Participants who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by the steering committee.\n\n## Attribution\n\nThis Code of Conduct is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4, available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html).
